    "I’m not sure if it is exactly a business problem, but I want to compare my hometown – Voronezh with my new city – Moscow. Voronezh is quite developed city with more than one million population. Obviously, life there is less expensive than in capital city. But this project gave me interesting idea – let’s compare these two places only from venue point if view. Maybe in this particular case there is no such terrific difference. Or maybe all neighborhoods of Voronezh closer to only suburban areas of Moscow, who knows? \n",
